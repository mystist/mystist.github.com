Do companies want to quickly implement large model applications? At least one large model application engineer is needed to develop and build using tools like Langchain.  
Managing a development team is too costly? What can you do?  
Agent Matrix can help! With Agent Matrix, you can quickly build your AI Agent workflow with simple prompts, helping your company leverage AI large model capabilities for business growth.  
(You can think of it as a UI version of Langchain, which is a tool for engineers to quickly build AI Agents. Agent Matrix, however, is designed for IT staff in companies and is a platform for quickly customizing AI Agent workflows through a UI.)
